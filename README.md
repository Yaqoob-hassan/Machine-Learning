# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains my personal collection of **Machine Learning (ML)** projects — built from scratch and using real-world datasets.  
Each project demonstrates my understanding of core ML concepts, data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

---

##  Project Categories
- **Supervised Learning**
  - Regression (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, etc.)
  - Classification (Decision Trees, SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- **Unsupervised Learning**
  - Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN)
  - Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, t-SNE)
- **Data Analysis & Visualization**
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Feature Engineering
  - Matplotlib / Seaborn visualizations

---

##  Tools & Technologies
- Python 
- NumPy, Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebooks  

---

##  Goal
This repo serves as a **learning hub and portfolio** of my progress in machine learning —  
from basic models to advanced algorithms — showing end-to-end data science workflows.

---

## Future Plans
- Add deep learning (TensorFlow / PyTorch) models  
- Build small real-world ML apps  
- Work on Kaggle datasets and competitions
